## Summary
**Goal:** Create an interactive apology website for Maham with a clickable name reveal mechanism.

**Planned changes:**
- Build a landing page displaying "Maham" as a prominent clickable element
- Implement a reveal interaction that shows the apology message when the name is clicked
- Apply a pink and red color scheme with white text throughout
- Design romantic, elegant styling with smooth CSS transitions

**User-visible outcome:** A visitor sees "Maham" displayed on the page, clicks it, and is presented with an apology message in a visually appealing pink/red themed design with white text.
